Description:
Wasteland is a post apocalyptic sandbox that evolved from Dynamic Zombies Sandbox by Craig/bobtom. Wasteland is a game mode that gives players a more PVP feel on the large map Chernarus.
The main objective of Wasteland is to scavenge for supplies, weapons vehicles and defend yourself against other factions. There are four factions in Wasteland (Blufor,Opfor,Civilian,Raiders). 
Civilians are given a choice if they want to work as a team with other civilians or go 'rogue' and became a blood thirsty raider leaving no survivors and taking what they want. While Wasteland is TVT focused
there are AI factions called 'Raiders' that spawn at side missions and will roam the wastes searching for targets. These AI are deadly and will kill you in a heart beat!

Features:
- Scavenging system: Scavenge for food, water, and guns
- Dynamic Vehicles & Objects to build bases with
- real-time base building capabilities by using R3F Logistics with modifications
- Survival like system: Enables hunger and dehydration
- Gun stores
- Spawn beacons for a mobile spawn for yourself
- Dynamic Environment

Known Issues:
Side missions: Side some side missions sometime bugs out, side missions weren't the primary focus of this version but in the upcoming versions I hope to revise them.
Player Menu: Every now an then (rarely) the player menu will bug out for JIP clients preventing them from opening the menu, for a fix just rejoin.
FPS Lag: Every now an then when the server starts with a lot of players (30+) most suffer from frame lag, can be fixed by using left shift + minus via numpad and typing F L U S H.

Upcoming plans:
With the coming updates I want to expand upon the side missions and improve upon them. Along with that I want to make the roaming AI more fluenent and dynamic along with various
dynamic skill changes upon each AI and have certain groups of AI for various rolls and also expand upon the hunger system and add more effects for the more hungerier you get and dehydrated.
