use advanced config: true
# all other advanced settings are ignored if this is set to false

afk integration: true
# If a compatible AFK plugin is found autorank will not count online time for AFK players
# This option is always on when using the SimpleConfig
# Currently supports: Essentials

use partial completion: true
# When this is true, players can use /ar complete # to complete a requirement at any moment they like.
# When this is false, players will only be able to /ar check and check for all requirements at one time. They would need to have all requirements at that moment.

interval check: 5
# This is the interval between checks of Autorank (in minutes).
# Lowering this number will increase accuracy but will also increase server lag.

leaderboard layout: '&6&r | &b&p - &7&d day(s), &h hour(s) and &m minute(s).'

# changes the appearance of the /ar leaderboard command
# &r : Ranking in the leaderboard
# &p : Player name
# &m : Minutes (with full days and full hours not counted)

# new requirements and results can be added by other plugins that hook into the Autorank API
# these are the ones that are included in the main plugin:
# 
#   requirements:
#       time: 1d 1h 1m
#       exp: 20 (level)
#       money: 2000 (requires vault ! Player has to have at least this amount of money)

#       blocks broken: id(;amount;data) (a player has to have broken x amount blocks of item id and data) (Requires Stats) (when no data or amount is given, it will check total blocks)
#       Example: break 10 magenta wool would be: 'blocks broken: 35;10;2' 35 = itemid, 10 = amount, 2 = damagevalue
#       blocks placed: id(;amount;data) (a player has to have placed x amount blocks of item id and data) (Requires Stats) (when no data or amount is given, it will check total blocks)

#       total time: 50d 1h (Player has to be with this server for at least 50 days and 1 hour) (The time from when the player joined for the first time is the reference point. This means that when a player has joined 3 weeks ago, his 'total time' = 3 weeks)
